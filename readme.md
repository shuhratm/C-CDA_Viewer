<h2>Personal Medical Records Features</h2>
Transform your C-CDA documents from healthcare providers into an intuitive, personal medical records management system:

- **üìã Smart Metadata Display**: Automatically extracts and displays patient names and actual visit dates from C-CDA files
- **üè† Home Server Deployment**: Docker-based deployment for secure access on your home network
- **üìÅ Folder-Based Management**: Simply place XML files in a folder - no database required
- **üì± Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **üé® Card-Based Interface**: Clean, modern interface showing patient info and encounter dates at a glance
- **üîí Privacy-First**: No cloud services, no external dependencies - your medical data stays on your server

<h2>Enhanced Personal Interface</h2>
The interface has been redesigned for personal use:
- **Patient Name Extraction**: Automatically shows "Firstname Lastname" from C-CDA patient records
- **Actual Visit Dates**: Displays real encounter dates instead of document export dates
- **Professional Cards**: Each record shown as a clean card with key information
- **Quick Navigation**: Click any card to instantly view the full C-CDA document
- **Loading Indicators**: Smooth loading states while parsing XML metadata

<h2>Platform</h2>
<ul>
<li>Runs in any modern browser (tested on FF 46.0, IE11 and Chrome 49, Safari). PC, tablet or mobile. </li>
<li>Will run as a standalone local fileset (not in Chrome, due to security issues)</li>
<li>Load onto any web file server to run on Chrome</li>
</ul>

<h2>Demonstration</h2>
A demonstration version is deployed here:
http://brynlewis.org/challenge/index.htm

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Users can control document layout via Section hide/show, collapse/expand and re-ordering. </li>
<li>As user makes changes, the layout adjusts to make best use of available screen space.</li>
<li>All changes are saved as preferences that will apply across documents (ie open a new document and the same order/visibility preferences are applied against all sections).</li>
<ul>
	<li>Sections are identified via coding applied across documents.</li>
	<li>eg. If 'Procedures' has been moved to the top of the document, then 'Procedures' will be at the top of the next document opened.</li>
</ul>
Sample documents are available, or you can cut and paste the xml of a C-CDA document into the text box, then click 'View'.
<li>Duplicate entries in tables are detected. The user can decide whether these are hidden or shown.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Move and Re-Ordering</h2>
<ul>
<li>Drag and Drop a section where you want it to go.</li>
<li>Move a section up to the top of the list by clicking on the double-up arrow.</li>
<li>Move a section down one by clicking on the single-down arrow.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Show/Hide Sections</h2>
<ul>
<li>Hide sections by clicking on the cross, or from the Table Of Contents (TOC)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Collapse/Expand sections</h2>
<ul>
<li>Click the collapse/expand icon on any section.</li>
<li>Collapse/Expand all section with the Collapse/Expand all button.</li>
</ul>

<h2>TOC (Table Of Contents)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Use the TOC to see all available sections in the document, and to show/hide or move sections.</li>
<li>Reset all preferences to defaults.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Personal Home Server Deployment</h2>

<h3>Quick Start with Docker</h3>
Deploy your personal medical records viewer in minutes:

**Prerequisites:**
- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your server
- A folder containing your C-CDA XML files from healthcare providers

**Steps:**
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shuhratm/C-CDA_Viewer.git
   cd C-CDA_Viewer
   ```

2. **Configure your medical records path:**
   Edit the `.env` file:
   ```bash
   # Port for the web application
   PORT=3000

   # Path to your medical records folder (absolute path recommended)
   RECORDS_PATH=/path/to/your/medical-records
   ```

3. **Deploy:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. **Access your medical records:**
   Open `http://your-server-ip:3000` in any browser

<h3>Detailed Configuration</h3>

**Environment Variables (.env file):**
- `PORT`: Web application port (default: 3000)
- `RECORDS_PATH`: Absolute path to folder containing your C-CDA XML files

**Supported File Formats:**
- Any `.xml` file containing valid C-CDA documents
- Files from major healthcare providers (Epic, Cerner, AllScripts, etc.)
- Documents downloaded from patient portals

**Network Access:**
- Designed for home network use (no authentication required)
- Access from any device on your network: computers, tablets, phones
- Use VPN or Tailscale for secure remote access

<h3>File Management</h3>
- **Adding Records**: Simply copy new XML files to your medical records folder
- **Organization**: Files are automatically sorted and displayed with metadata
- **No Database**: Everything runs from your files - no complex setup required

<h3>Security & Privacy</h3>
- **Local Only**: All processing happens on your server
- **No Cloud**: No data sent to external services
- **Read-Only**: Original files are never modified
- **Docker Isolation**: Application runs in secure container

<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
- **No files showing**: Check `RECORDS_PATH` points to correct folder with XML files
- **Permission errors**: Ensure medical records folder has read permissions
- **Port conflicts**: Change `PORT` in `.env` file to available port
- **View logs**: `docker-compose logs -f`

<h3>Original Static Deployment (Legacy)</h3>
For the original static file deployment:
- Download the fileset and open 'index.htm' in a web browser
- Or deploy to a web server at: `http://yoururl/[C-CDA_Viewer_path]/index.htm`


<h2>Technical Architecture</h2>

<h3>Personal Medical Records Application</h3>
**Backend (Node.js/Express):**
- `server.js`: Express server with medical records API endpoints
- `xml2js`: XML parsing for metadata extraction from C-CDA documents
- `/api/files`: Lists medical records with patient names and encounter dates
- `/api/file/:filename`: Serves individual C-CDA documents

**Frontend Enhancements:**
- `core.js`: Enhanced with metadata display and card-based interface
- `cda.css`: Added responsive card styling for medical records
- Smart loading states and modern UI components

**Metadata Extraction:**
- Patient names from `recordTarget/patientRole/patient/name` structure
- Encounter dates from actual visit records (not document export dates)
- Fallback logic for different C-CDA structures and formats

<h3>Original C-CDA Viewer Core</h3>
**XSLT Processing:**
- `xslt.js`: Browser-based XSL transformation library (updated for IE11 compatibility)
- `cda.xsl`: Extended ANSI/HL7 CDAR2 v.3 stylesheet with dynamic layout functionality
- Transformation: `new Transformation().setXml(cdaxml).setXslt('cda.xsl').transform("viewcda")`

**UI Libraries:**
- **Layout**: Packery.js library for responsive grid layout
- **Drag & Drop**: Draggabilly for section reordering
- **Icons**: Font Awesome icon set
- **Styling**: Pure CSS framework

**Document Structure:**
- `cdaxml`: C-CDA XML document string
- `cda.xsl`: Local XSL transformation file
- `viewcda`: Target HTML div for rendered content
